Notwithstanding the above, this Software shall not be sold or redistributed as a standalone product, nor shall it be wrapped in a trivial manner and sold or distributed as if it were an independent work, without the explicit prior written consent of the copyright holders; provided, however, that users may freely embed the Software into larger works, or modify and extend the Software, as long as such resulting works are substantially different from the original Software.

In the event that the Software is embedded into a larger work or modified and extended, the user agrees to clearly indicate in the resulting work that the Software was used, and to provide a link to the original source code repository.

For the purpose of determining whether a work is substantially different from the original Software, factors such as the addition of original code or creative work, the degree of customization, and the extent to which the Software is integral to the larger work shall be considered; however, no specific threshold of difference is established herby, and the determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis.

By accepting this license, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by its terms and conditions, and that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using the Software.
